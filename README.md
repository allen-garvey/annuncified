#Annuncified

Annuncified is an Android app that allows you to set custom notification sounds on a per contact basis. Annuncified listens for both SMS and MMS messages and plays the user selected ringtone based on who messaged you. There is also an option to have texts from non-contacts be set to silent so that you are not bothered by potentially spammy messages.

##Dependencies

* An Android phone with Jellybean or later
* Android Studio version 1.0 or later to compile the project
* A phone/carrier that supports android.hardware.telephony [see here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.html)

##Getting Started

* To avoid multiple notification sounds when you get a text, set your default notification sound to none in your main settings on your phone
* Annuncified must be restarted every time you restart your phone in order to work

##TODO

* Set notification sounds by Google Group
