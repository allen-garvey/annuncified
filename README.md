#Annuncified

Annuncified is a native Android app that allows you to set notification sounds by contact or Google group, as well as ringtones by Google group. You can also have calls and texts from non-contacts automatically silenced so that you are not bothered by telemarketers or wrong numbers.

##Dependencies

* An Android phone with Jellybean or later
* Android Studio version 1.0 or later to compile the project
* A phone/carrier that supports android.hardware.telephony [see here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.html)

##Getting Started

* To avoid multiple notification sounds when you get a text, set your default notification sound to none or silent in your main settings on your phone
* To avoid multiple ringtones when you get a call, set your default ringtone to none or silent in your main settings on your phone
