#Annuncified

Annuncified is an Android app that allows you to set custom notification sounds on a per contact basis. Annuncified listens for both SMS and MMS messages and plays the user selected ringtone based on who messaged you.

##Dependencies

* An Android phone with Jellybean or later
* Android Studio version 1.0 or later to compile the project
* A phone/carrier that supports android.hardware.telephony [see here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Telephony.html)

##Getting Started

* To avoid multiple notification sounds when you get a text, set your default notification sound to none in your main settings on your phone
* Annuncified must be restarted every time you restart your phone in order to work

##TODO

* Ignore messages from people not in your contacts
* Set notification sounds by Google Group
